# Spring Boot + R2DBC PoC project

Simple "Proof of Concept" project used to experiment using [R2DBC](https://r2dbc.io/) on [PostgreSQL](https://github.com/r2dbc/r2dbc-postgresql) along with [Spring WebFlux](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/5.1.5.RELEASE/spring-framework-reference/web-reactive.html).

## Running it

This project has been developed using [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) and [Spring Boot](https://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/) and can be executed using:

 > ./mvnw spring-boot:run

It requires a [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/). A [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml) is provided so one can run a PostgreSQL instance in a Docker container executing, for example:

 > docker-compose up --remove-orphans --force-recreate --build

Database's schema is automatically generated by [Liquibase](https://www.liquibase.org/) during application startup.

## Using it

Once it is up and running a `Person` record can be created using REST API, as for example, using [HTTPie](https://httpie.org/):

    $ http :8080/persons name="John Doo" birthday=1980-05-29
    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Content-Length: 50
    Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8
    
    {
        "birthday": "1980-05-29",
        "id": 4,
        "name": "John Doo"
    }

And then listing:

    $ http :8080/persons
    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8
    transfer-encoding: chunked
    
    [
        {
            "birthday": "1980-05-29",
            "id": 4,
            "name": "John Doo#4"
        },
        {
            "birthday": "1984-11-01",
            "id": 5,
            "name": "Foo Bar#5"
        }
    ]
